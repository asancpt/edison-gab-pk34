# Abstract

**Keywords**  
Reversible metabolism, cisplatin, monohydrate, multiple compartment

# Introduction

The aim of this exercise is to demonstrate how to implement a system of differential equations describing reversible metabolism. 
Data were taken from thε li〔eraturε on cisplatin kinetics (Andersson (1995]) and used [ O generate synthetic concentr따ion-time values for cisplatin p and its monohydrate m. 
This information was then used to obtain initial parameter estimates for a model of reversible metabolism. 
This exercise demonstrates how to implement the equations for this model into a program. 
In an infusion solution of cisplatin, equilibrium is established berween cisplatin and its monohydratε complex. 
Thus, the input rate can be split into cisplatin infusion ratε Iη and monohydra[ e infusion rate In,,
We have also chosen to describe thε εquilibrium process in vivo berween cisplatin and its monohydrate complex by means of rwo clearance rates.

Left: Observed (symbols) and predicted (solid lines) concentration time data of cisplatin and its monohydrate.
The symbols correspond to cisplatin (upper curve) and the monohydrate (bottom curve) after infusion of cisplatin which also contains the monohydrate, 
and cisplalin (second from bottom) and monohydrate (second from top) after monohydrate infusion.
Right: A two compaπment model mimicking reversible metabolism was used to model the data.

Initial parameter estimates
Procedures involved in obtaining initial parameter estimates, AUC, MRT,
and so on for a system of revεrsible processes are covered in depth in Ebling
and Jusko [1986] . The initial parameter estimates selected diffcεred a little
from the values used to gener따C the data.
Interpretation of results and conclusions
The observed and model-predicted plasma concentrations, and the final
parameter estimates are shown in Figure 34.1 and Table 34. 1, respectively.
